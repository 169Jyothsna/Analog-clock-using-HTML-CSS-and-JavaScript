# Analog-clock-using-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript
The "Analog Clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript" project is a simple web-based application that displays a functional analog clock. It uses HTML to create the structure of the clock, CSS to design and style the clock's face, hands, and overall appearance, and JavaScript to make the clock's hands move in real-time. The project helps understand the basic integration of these three technologies to create dynamic and visually appealing web elements.
